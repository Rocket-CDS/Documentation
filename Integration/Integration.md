#### What is Integration ?

Integration is considered to be any work that is "displayed" client side.  

There is a large grey area with what is considered integration, some people will consider building AppThemes as development.  And this is not wrong, AppThemes can be very complex or very simple, but it's usually the integrator that changes CSS and design.  Integrators are responsible for building the website and it is essential that they understand AppThemes and are able to use and edit them.     

If an integrator understands CSS and HTML they will be able to edit and understand AppThemes, even if they never want to create one.

#### What is an AppTheme?

AppThemes are a group of text files that run on the website/web-system to create the required data entry and display.

The text files are a mixture of types: CSS, HTML, RAZOR, XML.
