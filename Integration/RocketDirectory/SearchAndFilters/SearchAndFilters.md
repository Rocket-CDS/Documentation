# Rocket Directory Search And Filters

The Rocket Directory systems have the ability to do search on filtering on large lists of data.  

This can be used to create highly complex functionality to make the clients requirements.  

The Directory systems can also have plugins created to adapt the default functionality of the directory, this is an extremely time saving advantage for large complex directory systems that would usually mean starting an entire project from a blank page.
